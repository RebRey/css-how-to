    <h1>Demonstrating Font Styling</h1>

    <p>
      The CSS properties used to style text generally fall into two categories:
      font styles and text layout styles.
    </p>

    <hr class="class-1" />

    <h2>Font Styles</h2>
    <p>
      Properties that affect a text's font, e.g., which font gets applied, its
      size, and whether it's bold, italic, etc.
    </p>
    <br />
    <hr />

    <h3>Color</h3>
    <p>
      The color property sets the color of the foreground content of the
      selected elements, which is usually the text.
    </p>
    <p class="color-red">This text is colored red.</p>
    <p class="color-green">This text is colored green.</p>
    <br />
    <hr />

    <h3>Font Families</h3>
    <p>
      The font-family property allows you to specify a font (or list of fonts)
      for the browser to apply to the selected elements. The browser will only
      apply a font if it is available on the machine the website is being
      accessed on; if not, it will just use a browser default font.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">This is what the serif font looks like.</p>
    <p class="sans-serif">This is what the sans-serif font looks like.</p>
    <p class="monospace">This is what the monospace font looks like.</p>
    <p class="cursive">This is what the cursive font looks like.</p>
    <p class="fantasy">This is what the fantasy font looks like.</p>
    <br />
    <hr />

    <h3>Font Stacks</h3>
    <p>
      Since you can't guarantee the availability of the fonts you want to use on
      your webpages (even a web font could fail for some reason), you can supply
      a font stack so that the browser has multiple fonts it can choose from.
      This involves a font-family value consisting of multiple font names
      separated by commas.
    </p>
    <p class="font-stack">
      This text has the following font stack: font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',
      'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
    </p>
    <br />
    <hr />

    <h3>Font Size</h3>
    <p>
      Font size is set with the font-size property. It can take values measured
      in px (pixels), em, and rem.
    </p>
    <p class="px30">This text is 30px (pixels).</p>
    <p class="px40">This text is 40px (pixels).</p>
    <p class="em1">This text is 1 em.</p>
    <p class="em2">This text is 2 em.</p>
    <p class="rem1">This text is 1 rem.</p>
    <p class="rem2">This text is 2 rem.</p>
    <br />
    <hr />

    <h3>Font Style</h3>
    <p>
      Used to turn italic text on or off. Possible values are as follows (you'll
      rarely use this, unless you want to turn some italic styling off for some
      reason):
    </p>
    <p class="normal-style">
      The normal property sets the text to the normal font (turns existing
      italics off).
    </p>
    <p class="italic-style">
      The italic property sets the text to use the italic version of the font,
      if available; if not, it will simulate italics with oblique instead.
    </p>
    <p class="oblique-style">
      The oblique property sets the text to use a simulated version of an italic
      font, created by slanting the normal version.
    </p>
    <br />
    <hr />

    <h3>Font Weight</h3>
    <p>
      Sets how bold the text is. This has many values available in case you have
      many font variants available (such as -light, -normal, -bold, -extrabold,
      -black, etc.), but realistically you'll rarely use any of them except for
      normal and bold:
    </p>
    <p class="normal-weight">
      This has a normal weight. Same as the numerical value 400
    </p>
    <p class="lighter-weight">This has a lighter weight.</p>
    <p class="bold-weight">
      This has a bold weight. Same as the numerical value 700
    </p>
    <p class="bolder-weight">This has a bolder weight.</p>
    <p class="one-hundred-weight">
      This has a 100 value weight, also known as thin or hairline.
    </p>
    <p class="two-hundred-weight">
      This has a 200 value weight, also known as extra light or ultra light.
    </p>
    <p class="three-hundred-weight">
      This has a 300 value weight, also known as light.
    </p>
    <p class="four-hundred-weight">
      This has a 400 value weight, also known as normal or regular.
    </p>
    <p class="five-hundred-weight">
      This has a 500 value weight, also known as medium.
    </p>
    <p class="six-hundred-weight">
      This has a 600 value weight, also known as semi bold or demi bold.
    </p>
    <p class="seven-hundred-weight">
      This has a 700 value weight, also known as bold.
    </p>
    <p class="eight-hundred-weight">
      This has a 800 value weight, also known as extra bold or ultra bold.
    </p>
    <p class="nine-hundred-weight">
      This has a 900 value weight, also known as black or heavy.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Text Transform</h3>
    <p>Allows you to set your font to be transformed. Values include:</p>
    <p class="none-transformation">
      None transformation prevents any transformation.
    </p>
    <p class="uppercase-transformation">
      Uppercase transforms all text to capitals.
    </p>
    <p class="lowercase-transformation">
      Lowercase transforms all text to lower case.
    </p>
    <p class="capitalize-transformation">
      Capitalize transforms all words to have the first letter capitalized.
    </p>
    <p class="full-width-transformation">
      Full width Transforms all glyphs to be written inside a fixed-width
      square, similar to a monospace font, allowing aligning of, e.g., Latin
      characters along with Asian language glyphs (like Chinese, Japanese,
      Korean). 一 二 三 大 鳥
    </p>

    <h3>Text Decoration</h3>
    <p>

      default underline on links when styling them). Available values are:
    </p>
    <p class="none-decoration">
      The normal property sets the text to the normal font (turns existing
      italics off).

    <h2>Text Layout Styles</h2>
    <p>
      Properties that affect the spacing and other layout features of the text,
      allowing manipulation of, for example, the space between lines and
      letters, and how the text is aligned within the content box.
